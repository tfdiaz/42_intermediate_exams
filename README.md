# Intermediate Exams Problems from 42 Silicon Valley

[42 Silicon Valley](https://www.42.us.org/) administers a 4 hour exam every Tuesday. One of the requirements of being a student is taking an exam at least twice a month. I haven't included the beginner exam and at the time of writing this there is yet to be an advance exam.

To completely pass one needs to score above an 84 out of 100 from an average of the top 5 exams. Problems are randomly generated each time.

* Level 0 - 4 - 16 points
* Level 5 - 20 points

The problems are considered more difficult the higher the level.

All implementations pass successfully from 42's testing suite.
